# Palette

## Included
- Before the elves created the ley lines, places of power were exceptionally rare, and usually tied to demonic, druidic or divine power, or mythic resonance.
- The mantle is an almost impermeable barrier which encapsulates all of the planes that are coterminous to or which intersect with the prime material.  There is also void within the mantle, but it has been influenced by the planetary planes and other inner planes.
- Beyond the mantle lies the Outerdark, a "deep void" which is particularly dangerous and terrible.
- Halflings were not created by any god, but sprang directly into being from the earth itself.  They were the first intelligent creatures in creation.
- Powerful magical engineering/infrastructure and magical technology in antiquity.
- The Ever is a place where elves go when they're done in Kalemin.  It is not on the prime material plane.
- The contents within the Mantle are theoretically finite, but that boundary is yet unknown.  Energy can be converted from one type of magic to another, but one comes at a cost to the other types, and the energy cannot be created from scratch.  Except by bards, which is mysterious, and infuriating to some...
- Planes of the gods are visible as constellations and can be traveled to.
- The Unreliable Narrator.
- The Pantheon as we know it is not complete.

~~~
~~~

## Excluded
- Overt displays of Divine power by the Forgotten after the Pantheon War.  They do not get to directly influence the world after this.
- Dragons after the Pantheon War.
- No other races are descended from elves.
- No Gith.
- No Feywild.
- No dragons other than the five chromatic and five metallic types.  Dracoliches are allowed, if you reanimate one of the ten existing types.

## The Age of Creation
*Period, Light*

The father of the gods, Kalemiel, makes the mantle, and then makes the gods.  Then he teaches them how to create. "The Gods Slept In the Vast Unformed Void, and dreamt of a world that was broken.  When they woke, they built the world that is."  Then, Kalemiel leaves his children to their creation.

### The Restless Void Stirs
*Event, Dark*

The dreams of the children of Kalemiel sent ripples out into the vast unformed void.  There, in the endless dark, *Older Things than They*, sleeping their own slumber, stirred and grew anxious, and their dreams moved toward Kalemin.


## Dawn Age
*Period, Light*

Sentient creatures come into being.

### Echoes of the Outer Dark
*Event, Light*

The strange dreams of the Old Powers ripple against the shores of reality and vibrate throughout it, creating unexpected variations on the designs of the Gods.



### Emergence of the Old Blood
*Event, Light*

> #### Gods Meet First Mortals
> *Scene, Dark*
> 
- What was the reaction of the Gods when they met the first sentient mortals?
- Required Characters: Halfling Matriarch, Illdar, Yagdul
- Forbidden Characters: No other gods are present.
> 
The scene is in a first halfling village. The Old Blood have begun to tell stories to one another, and have created the first mythic resonance, as a result.  Creation is changing because of them, in a way the Gods did not predict.  Illdar, fascinated and not a little bit fearful of this development, goes to the material plane to speak with the eldest matriarch of the Old Blood tribe that had gathered there.  Yagdul is secretly listening in on them.

### Division Created Between the Gods
*Event, Dark, Legacy (Alex)*

Yagdul eavesdrops over the conversation between the Matriarch and Illdar, and becomes insanely jealous.  This plants the permanent seed of division between the gods.

~~~
~~~

### Yagdul Creates The Get
*Event, Dark*

Yagdul bands together with several other gods, and create ‘The Get’ in the furthest most isolated regions of Kalemin in an attempt to mimic the growing relationship between Illdar and the Blood Tribe. The Get are a poor attempt at sentience that goes horribly wrong. The other gods learn of this attempt and are abhorred. This further erodes relations between the gods.

> #### Yagdul's Progeny Corrupted and Consumed by the Creatures of the Void
> *Scene, Dark*
>
> The Hungering Gulf corrupts the creations of Yagdul and Azre.
>
___
> - **Question:** What went wrong during the creation of Yagdul's Children?
> - **Stage:** The moment of the creation of The Get.
> - **What Just Happened?:** Yagdul, having been jealous of The Old Blood, and Illdar's Children, banded together with some other gods. Something goes wrong.
> - **Required Characters:** Yagdul, One of the Old Powers.
> - **Banned Characters:** Illdar, mortals
>
> ##### **Other Notes:**
> 
- Yagdul is filled with childlike glee, having dreamed of this moment for so long.
- The Hungering Gulf desires to consume.
- Azre, Goddess of Magic, having created the network of magical flows on Kalemin, has noticed that the mortals create power just by existing and believing, and she wants to imbue a greater ability for *that* in their new creation.  She wants them to be *machines* for altering mythic resonance.
- Eyes bubbling up like foam, the male eats the female, the flows begin to undulate around *the mass*.  The form vomits forth a slightly different but equally awful female.  The things seem to grow from the act of consumption.  They seem to be covered in a kind of *film* that you cannot remove.
- Yagdul begins to suspect that Azre corrupted the creation on purpose, to humiliate him.

### The Predation of The Get
*Event, Dark*

As the races spread out into the world, they encounter things that were *not like them*.  Things with many limbs sometimes less, many eyes, sometimes less, and *all of them* were very hungry, and very violent.

The Dawn Races struggle in this state of constant predation by **The Get**, until they are able to establish rudimentary formal defensible settlements, and learn to treat the wilds where these creatures live with caution.

### Irion Erects The Wall
*Event, Light*

The Empire Irion Erects a wall to separate themselves from Círin Muor.  The wall is comprised of a regular series of watch posts that form a kind of magical net between them.  This does not *stop* the Get that pour out from the Muor, but it does alert them, and allow them time to respond.  In this way, the Get are prevented from rampaging into the Heartland of Irion.

*Period, Light*

The dwarves carve their first and some of their greatest cities from the mountains.

Irion, the seat of the elven empire, is completely destroyed in this apocalypse, and the lands surrounding it are sunk into the sea and utterly destroyed.  The wild magical energy causes the sea to roil.

### Ritual to Free Círin Muor
*Event, Light*

The elves use the combined ley energy from across Aelvarel to try to unlock or free the vast wilderness of Círin Muor, the ancient jungle from which the elves and the Old Blood emerged.  They plan to usher in a new bright era of elven civilization, and unlock the savage lands of Círin Muor.  However, they fail.  And it nearly destroys the world.

 


> #### Iotaca Slays Irhalian
> *Scene, Dark*
>
> The Gold Elves have arrogantly decided that they should have dominion over Círin Muor.   Irhalian, the focus of the ritual, has gathered her high priests together in the city of Irion to conduct the ritual.
> 
> However, the Green Elves have a serious issue with that.  The Muor is Sacred.  Iotaca, a Green Elf assassin, chosen for his skill as a hunter, lets loose the arrow that slays Irhalian in retribution.  The magic slips from her fingers, and triggers the Catastrophe.  The Magic of Círin Muor must not be assailed, but the Green elves could not have known what would happen.

 

### Elves Redirect the Ley Lines
*Event, Light*

Over the centuries that follow, the elves that remain in Eilsrahel systematically redirect the magical flows from across Eilsrahel and what parts of Eitrahel they have any influence over (it is so wild, this is limited and difficult), so that they no longer point toward the Inner Sea.  It is calmed, somewhat, but they are unable to halt the old ley lines from Iyuth Orai, so the Inner Sea continues to change.

> #### Discovery of Adamantite
> *Scene, Light*
>
> There is a riotous celebration as the Drow celebrate the successful completion of the Ritual, and unbind the Underdark near Varrav Gazzan.  During the celebration, an exploration team is sent into the previously unavailable areas, and they first encounter Adamantite.

Illdar creates a new priesthood charged with scouring all remnants of the Forgotten from the world.  All temples, all relics, all memories, songs, artifacts, anything that ever referenced them was scoured from the world, *violently*.

That priesthood never went away, because they were never completely successful.


### The First Coming of the Second Sun
*Event, Dark*

A bright red comet appears in the celestial tapestry.  It is larger and brighter than any of the stars, which form the divine constellations.

> *Scene, Light*
___
> - **Question:** How did the young bards of She'Renar "battle" the Illdaran Inquisition?
> - **Characters:** The Sparrow
> 
> The Sparrow's favorite thing was perching on windows, especially those in large open spaces such as royal meeting halls or temples.  He did not just perch there, but to watch the reactions to his handiwork, which were massive lines of text all over the walls, surfaces, carpet, or furniture of whatever room he had paid a visit to.  His crowning achievement was writing of the banishment of the Forgotten throughout the Grand Hall of Illdar's largest temple in She'Renar, which enraged the Inquisition because of its sheer brazenness.


### The Gift of Athanasius
*Event, Light*

> - **Required Characters:** Anthellar Asoneas, Patriarch of House Asoneas.
> - **Banned Characters:**  The leaders of house Saída, as they were not descended from the nobles of Irion.  All commoners.
>
> ##### **Other Notes :**
- Minor houses in attendance, led by Arinar Faeseus are nervous about the show of force that the Orcs have made, and are impatient for a solution to be agreed upon. (Time)
- Anthellar Asoneas, of House Asoneas is a very, very old elf and his family survived the apocalypse by being conservative, so he is trying to think long term and not be brash.
- Marolan Cariel: House Cariel lost a lot of lives in the defense of the city.  Their knights were on the walls when they came crashing down, and it was not good.  Although their numbers are depleted greatly, they have a dire need for vengeance.  They will not stand idly by as the Orcs rampage through the elven countryside.
- Ylna Asari, of House Asari.  Has an idea for how to harness the magic of the land to destroy the Riven Fleet.

> - **What Just Happened?:** Rumination has gone on before this. Ganemel brings news of some impending danger to the house, but Cenyd is mistrustful of his advice.  Touriel believes that an important secret has been lost, and if uncovering it means heresy, then she has resigned herself to that course.
> - **Required Characters:** Touriel Saída, her brother Cenyd Saída, and Ganemel, the Seneschal of House Saída
> - **Banned Characters:** None.
>
> ##### **Other Notes:**
> 
> The **Reliquants** of House Saída have returned with an ancient, original copy of a historic tome from the Reliquary below the Bardic Citadel, which means the history texts have been fabricated.  Ganemel brings the tomes to the lady Touriel, and Cenyd and Touriel debate whether the discrepencies have meaning.

~~~
~~~

> #### The Trial of Gnaeus Octavius Pisentius
> *Scene, Dark*
>
> The trial of Gnaeus Octavius Pisentius
>
___
> - **Question:** How do you put someone on trial if you are a secret organization?
> - **Stage:** Early summer, the previous capitol of the Dwarven Empire Gahtal'ganad.  It is the pinnacle of the dwarven empire, built into an entire mountainside.  It is not a sprawling city like human establishments, but is very tall.  The Inquisition has just discovered that Pisentius is a heretic.

> - **Required Characters:** Gnaeus Septimus Pisentius, a secret officer in the Illdaran Inquisition, and the accused's older brother.
> - **Banned Characters:** Gnaeus Octavius Pisentius
> - **Other Characters:** Curate Hakan (a human), and Nelius Tertius Vorena, a snivelling lickspittle on the council, and notorious sycophant to powerful dominion figures.
>
> ##### **Other Notes:**
> 
> Hakan, a collaborator with the Dominion government, spends most of his time trying to advance himself.  This entire situation stinks to him, and he wants to know why his shoes are being stepped on.  He doesn't give a damn about Octavius Pisentius, but he is very upset by the breach of protocol, and the vagueness of the whole thing.  Septimus sees Hakan as replaceable, and is willing and empowered to unseat him, if need be.  Nelius is *very* intrigued by the possibility of a power vacuum.
> - Hakan doesn't appreciate the lack of public trial.  Gnaeus Septimus pours water and poison in a cup and offers it up as "evidence" which is too deadly to be observed.
> - Gnaeus Septimus shows evidence to Hakan and Nelius Tertius that his own brother is leading a ceremony to "A Dark and Nameless God".  The evidence is a scrying pool.
> - Hakan is in charge of the city guard, and Nelius's mother is a priestess of Illdar, so he's being installed as a pawn.
> - Hakan is convinced when Gnaeus Septimus shows him his son at the ceremony, with a veiled threat.

## Overview of Play

You should have already followed the steps in “Starting a New Game” to build the foundation of your history.

Decide which player will start: that player becomes the first Lens. If someone is teaching the game, they should be the 1st Lens. You can give the Lens a large and visible object to remind everyone at the table who it is.

1. **Declare the Focus:** The Lens declares the current Focus of the game, the part of history you’re going to explore right now.
2. **Make History:** Each player takes a turn creating either a Period, Event or Scene. The Lens goes first, then go down the list of players. What you create must relate to the current Focus.
<br/><br/>The Lens can choose to create two things on her turn, so long as they are nested inside each other: either a new Event plus a Scene inside that Event, or a new Period plus an Event inside that Period. This gives the Lens more power to get the Focus going.<br/><br/>
3. **Lens Finishes the Focus:** After each player has taken a turn, the Lens gets to go again and add another Period, Event or Scene (or two nested things). This lets the Lens have the last word about the Focus.
<br/><br/>After all players have addressed the Focus, we take a step back and examine Legacies, elements of the history we want to remember to explore later on:<br/><br/>
4. **Choose a New Legacy:** The player before the Lens picks something from play during this last Focus and makes it a Legacy.
5. **Explore a Legacy:** The same player creates an Event or dictated Scene that relates to one of the Legacies, either the one just created or one already in play.
6. **New Lens:** The player after the Lens then becomes the new Lens and picks a new Focus. Repeat.
<br/>
<br/>Before the new Lens starts, you may want to take a quick intermission and talk about how the game is going. Talk about what you’ve liked or what intrigues you, but don’t plan what’s going to happen next.
<br/>
<br/>That’s the whole game in a nutshell. Each step is described in more detail in the rest of the **Microscope RPG** book.
